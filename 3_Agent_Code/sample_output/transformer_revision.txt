🔹 Topic: Transformer Architecture
------------------------------
🔹 **Subtopic**: Transformer Architecture

📖 **Summary**:
Transformers are a neural network architecture that revolutionized NLP by replacing recurrent layers with self-attention mechanisms. They process sequences in parallel rather than sequentially, making them highly efficient for training. The architecture consists of encoder-decoder stacks, each containing multi-head attention and feed-forward layers.

📝 **Key Points**:
- Self-attention mechanism allows each position to attend to all positions in the input sequence
- Positional encoding adds sequence order information since attention is permutation-invariant
- Multi-head attention runs multiple attention functions in parallel for richer representations
- Layer normalization and residual connections stabilize training in deep networks
- Encoder-decoder structure: encoder processes input, decoder generates output autoregressively

🔹 Topic: Attention Mechanisms
------------------------------
🔹 **Subtopic**: Attention Mechanisms

📖 **Summary**:
Attention mechanisms allow models to focus on relevant parts of input when making predictions. In transformers, self-attention computes attention weights between all pairs of positions in a sequence. The mechanism uses Query, Key, and Value matrices to determine which parts of the input are most relevant for each output position.

📝 **Key Points**:
- Attention(Q,K,V) = softmax(QK^T/√d_k)V formula computes weighted representations
- Self-attention relates different positions within the same sequence
- Cross-attention relates positions between different sequences (encoder-decoder)
- Multi-head attention captures different types of relationships simultaneously
- Attention weights provide interpretability by showing which inputs the model focuses on

🔹 Topic: Positional Encoding
------------------------------
🔹 **Subtopic**: Positional Encoding

📖 **Summary**:
Since transformers process sequences in parallel without inherent position awareness, positional encodings are added to input embeddings to inject sequence order information. The original transformer uses sinusoidal functions with different frequencies to create unique position representations that the model can learn to utilize.

📝 **Key Points**:
- PE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/10000^(2i/d_model)) for even dimensions
- PE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/10000^(2i/d_model)) for odd dimensions
- Sinusoidal encoding allows extrapolation to longer sequences than seen during training
- Learned positional embeddings are an alternative approach used in some models
- Position information is crucial for tasks requiring understanding of word order
